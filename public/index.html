      On your birthday, I want to say thank you...
    </p>
    <p>
      For raising me. For my happy childhood. For standing back
      and turning me loose. For letting me make my mistakes. For helping me clean up my messes.
    </p>
    <p class="fancy">For loving me so much.</p>
    <p>
      For balancing just what I wanted and just what I needed. For being on my side. For being my lighthouse in an
      often
      dark ocean
      and putting me in a better place anytime I'm down.
    </p>
    <p>
      For making it all better. For being my mom. For being my friend.
    </p>
    <p class="fancy">
      For being The Best!!
